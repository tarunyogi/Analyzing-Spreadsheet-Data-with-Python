# Analyzing-Spreadsheet-Data-with-Python

A program to analyze an excel spreadsheet with raw data from a paired pulse electrophysiology experiment.


### About

This program takes raw data from a paired pulse experiment and calculates the paired-pulse ratio


### Data Organization
Each experiment should be organized as:

    Column 1 = interstimulus interval

    Column 2 = raw slope or amplitude of pulse 1
  
    Column 3 = raw slope or amplitude of pulse 2
  

Analyzed PPR will be output to a new sheet named "Your Sheet PPR"

    For each experiment:
  
    Column 1 = interstimulus interval
  
    Column 2 = paired pulse ratio
    
    
### Output  
Data is output to a new sheet in the original file.
